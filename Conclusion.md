3. The most frequent appointments were those scheduled on the same day, and *75%* of the scheduled appointments had a maximum gap of *15* days.
    - The gap between schedule date and appointment date is categorized into 4 main groups (according to the descriptive statistics):
        - ***Same Day:*** Appointments scheduled on the same day (*0* days gap).
        - ***Narrow Gap:*** the gap between the scheduling date and the appointment date is between *1* and *4* days.
        - ***Moderate Gap:*** the gap is between *5* and *15* days.
        - **Long Gap:*** the gap is more than *15* days.

4. *"JARDIM CAMBURI"* is the most common neighborhood, with *7,717* appointments and *4,192* patients.

5. *90.70%* of patients did not have a scholarship, while *9.29%* had one (*7.55%* female, *1.74%* male).

6. *19.65%* of patients are diagnosed with Hypertension (*13.66%* female, *5.99%* male).
    - the elderly group, patients diagnosed with hypertension make up a larger percentage *(7.38%)* compared to those without hypertension *(5%)*.

7. *7.09%* Diabetic Patients (*4.9%* Female,*2.19%* male).
    - Most Diabetic Patients fall within the Middle-Aged and Elderly Stages.

8. *2.72%* patients with alcohol-related problems (*4.9%* Female, *2.19%* male).
    - Most patients with alcohol-related problems fall within the Middle-Aged and Elderly Stages.

9. *1.82 %* of patients were classified having a handicap ranging from low to severe levels (*1.01%* female, *0.81%* male). 
    - Most handicapped patients fall within the Middle-Aged and Elderly Stages.

10. *35,482* appointment confirmations were sent to patients (*32.1%* of total appointments).

11. *88,208* patients attended their scheduled appointments (*79.81%* of total appointments).

## ***Findings:***
***1. Gender:***
- The data indicates that the majority of patients are women, except in the child category.
- The data shows that *79.69%* of females and *80.03%* of males attended their appointments. This negligible difference suggests that gender has no significant impact on appointment attendance. Other factors, such as age or health conditions, may play a larger role in determining attendance rates.

***2. Ages Satages:***
- The Middle-aged category represents the highest recorded percentage _(32.19%)_, followed by the adult category at *23.91%* and the child category at *20.35%*. The Teenage and Elderly categories had the lowest recorded percentages, at 11.18% and 12.38%, respectively.
- In general, the highest frequency of hospital visits is among the Elderly, Middle-aged, and Child categories, primarily for regular check-ups. This explains their higher commitment to attending appointments, with attendance rates of _84.44%, 82.14%, and 79.51%_, respectively. This pattern suggests that age groups have a positive impact on attendance rates

***3. Appointment Gap:***
- There is a clear relationship between the time gap of scheduling and attendance rates. As the gap between scheduling and the appointment grows, attendance decreases. Same-day or short-term scheduling increases the likelihood of patients attending their appointments, while a longer gap between scheduling and the appointment increases the likelihood of patients missing their appointments.
- **Suggestions:**
    - Concentrate scheduling preferences mainly on same-day and short-term appointments.
    - Set automated confirmation messages to be sent to patients prior to their appointments, especially for moderate to long gap periods.

***4. Neiborhood:***
- "ILHA Do Boi" and "AEROPORTO" have recorded the highest attendance rates (*91.43% & 87.5%*, respectively), despite not being among the top ten hospital locations in terms of appointment count or number of recorded patients.
- In contrast, "JARDIM CAMBURI," classified as the top hospital location for both recorded patients and appointment count, has an attendance rate of 81.02%.
- Neighborhoods with the highest attendance rates tend to have the lowest number of appointments per neighborhood
- There is insufficient data to fully support this assumption.
- **Additional Researches:**
    -  Further investigation regarding the cause of the higher attendance rate of those neighborhoods
    -  More research is needed to see if how close patients live to these neighborhoods affects attendance rates.
    -  Examining the relationship between distance and appointment availability.

### ***5. scholarships:***
- The difference in attendance rates (*80.19% vs. 76.26%*) between patients without scholarships and those with scholarships can be considered an indicator, but it may not be a strong one on its own. The gap is noticeable, but relatively small (*3.93%*).
- **Further research:**
    - Analyze more data to see if this pattern holds consistently across larger or different samples.
    - Conduct statistical tests to check if the difference is significant.
